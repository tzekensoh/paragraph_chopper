## ðŸš€ Quick Start (Ubuntu/Linux)

### ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Babashka (install with: `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babashka/babashka/master/install | bash`)

---

### ðŸ§ª Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tzekensoh/paragraph_chopper.git
cd paragraph_chopper

# Make sure Babashka is installed
bb server.clj


To share your local server with others, install ngrok, then run ngrok http 8080 in a separate terminal.
This will generate a public HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok-free.app) that tunnels directly to your local app at
http://localhost:8080.

If itâ€™s your first time using ngrok, register at ngrok.com, get your auth token,
and run ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE to enable access.
